Node?) on each invocation\n\n### merge/resolver.test.ts (10.34s)\n- Each of 14 tests creates a fresh git repo via `beforeEach`\n- Tests then do 4-8 git operations each (commit, branch, checkout, merge, rm, status)\n- Some tests set up identical conflict scenarios (setupContentConflict, setupDeleteModifyConflict, setupReimagineScenario called multiple times)\n\n### worktree/manager.test.ts (4.18s)\n- Three separate `describe` blocks each with their own `beforeEach` creating fresh repos\n- 16 tests × (git init + config + add + commit + mkdir) = ~80 subprocess spawns\n\n## Optimization Ideas (investigate, pick best ROI)\n\n1. **Share repos within describe blocks** — Use `beforeAll` instead of `beforeEach` where tests don't mutate shared state, or create a base repo once and clone/branch per test\n2. **Batch git config** — Combine the 2 git config calls into 1 subprocess (or use GIT_AUTHOR_NAME/GIT_COMMITTER_NAME env vars instead)\n3. **beads/client: reduce bd CLI spawns** — The bd CLI startup cost dominates. Options:\n   - Share one initialized repo across tests that don't conflict (list/ready tests need isolation, but create/show don't)\n   - Create multiple issues in beforeAll, then test against them\n4. **resolver: share conflict setups** — setupContentConflict and setupDeleteModifyConflict are called by multiple tests. Create the conflict once, then run assertions against it\n5. **Parallelize independent subprocess calls** — git config user.email and git config user.name are independent and can run concurrently via Promise.all\n6. **Consider git template dir** — Pre-configure a template with user.email/user.name so git init picks them up automatically, eliminating 2 spawns per repo\n\n## Target\nGet the suite under 10s while keeping the no-mock philosophy (real git repos, real bd CLI).","notes":"## Additional Finding: Temp Dir Leakage\n\n120 orphaned `overstory-test-*` directories found in $TMPDIR:\n- 119/120 contain only `.beads/issues.jsonl` with test data (e.g. 'Limit issue 1')\n- 1/120 still has a full `.git/` repo\n- ~716K total disk usage (small but accumulates)\n- `.git/` dirs are cleaned but `.beads/` persists, suggesting cleanup is partial or interrupted test runs skip `afterEach`\n\n**No contamination of project state:**\n- Project `.beads/issues.jsonl` has zero test issues (tests properly use isolated temp dirs)\n- No leaked git branches in the main repo\n- Git history is clean\n\n**Root cause:** `afterEach` calls `cleanupTempDir()` which does `rm(dir, { recursive: true })`. When tests are interrupted (Ctrl+C, timeout, crash), `afterEach` never fires and dirs accumulate. With ~40 temp dirs created per full test run, a few interrupted runs = 100+ orphans.\n\n**Potential fix:** Add a cleanup-on-start pattern: at the beginning of the test suite, scan $TMPDIR for stale `overstory-test-*` dirs and remove them.

Simple but loses history.\n2. **Mail archiving/purging** — `overstory mail purge --agents-gone` to delete mail to/from agents that no longer have active sessions.

Archive older data.\n5. **Workflow boundaries** — Tag mail/sessions with a workflow ID. `overstory status` only shows current workflow's data.\n\nOption 3 feels most natural — cleanup should happen at the same time agents are being cleaned.

{"id":"overstory-eqj0","title":"Hybrid enforcement: coordinator delegation must use overstory sling (structural + behavioral)","description":"Parent epic for the coordinator delegation enforcement problem. The coordinator agent uses Claude Code built-in Task tool instead of overstory sling, completely bypassing the overstory system (no worktrees, no mail, no groups, no specs). The fix requires a hybrid approach: (1) STRUCTURAL: Block Task/TeamCreate/SendMessage tools via PreToolUse hooks in hooks-deployer.ts for coordinator and supervisor capabilities (overstory-x6xm). (2) BEHAVIORAL: Update coordinator.md and supervisor.md with explicit prohibitions, a NATIVE_DELEGATION failure mode, and a workaround heuristic — if you are reaching for workarounds you should be delegating (overstory-q4nb). (3) OBSERVABILITY: Fix tool logging so we can detect this behavior from logs instead of requiring tmux capture (overstory-nq0y). Neither structural nor behavioral enforcement alone is sufficient (Gastown learned this too). The hybrid ensures the model cannot use Task even if it wants to, AND understands why it should use overstory sling instead.","notes":"Additional design flaw: overstory coordinator start deploys hooks to project root .claude/settings.local.json, which affects ALL Claude Code sessions in the project, not just the coordinator. Slinged agents get hooks in their worktree (isolated), but the coordinator has no worktree.

Writing to `.claude/` at root makes it only work inside its own repo — the target project's `.claude/` gets polluted with overstory-specific hook config.\n\n2. **ENV_GUARD was a band-aid, not a fix**: The ig8t fix added `[ -z \"$OVERSTORY_AGENT_NAME\" ]` guards so hooks don't fire for non-overstory sessions, but the hooks are still physically present in the project's `.claude/settings.local.json`, which is wrong.\n\n## Root Cause\n\n- `src/agents/hooks-deployer.ts` writes hooks to `\u003cprojectRoot\u003e/.claude/settings.local.json`\n- The coordinator has no worktree (it runs at project root), so it deploys hooks directly to root `.claude/`\n- Slinged agents correctly get hooks in their worktree, but the coordinator does not\n\n## Required Fix\n\nAll overstory hooks config must live inside `.overstory/`, NOT in `.claude/`.

The orchestrator was never triggered to:\n1. Read the merge_ready message\n2. Commit the work in the builder's worktree (builder couldn't commit, lead couldn't commit, so work sat uncommitted)\n3. Run overstory merge\n4. Tear down the lead and builder agents\n\nThe messages were only surfaced when the USER manually typed a prompt, which triggered the UserPromptSubmit hook (overstory mail check --inject). This means the entire orchestration pipeline stalls at the merge step until a human intervenes.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nMail delivery to the orchestrator is entirely pull-based:\n- UserPromptSubmit hook fires overstory mail check --inject\n- This only triggers when the USER submits a prompt\n- There is no push mechanism for agents to wake the orchestrator\n\nThe orchestrator (user's Claude Code session) sits idle between user messages. When an agent completes work and sends mail, that mail sits in the SQLite DB until the next UserPromptSubmit hook fires.\n\n## Evidence from latest run\n\nTimeline:\n- 21:00:27 — lead dispatches builder-steelman-2\n- 21:04:24 — lead sends merge_ready to orchestrator\n- 21:04:48 — lead sends worker_done to orchestrator\n- ??? — orchestrator does nothing until user types a message minutes later\n- lead-steelman tmux session still alive even after worker_done\n\n## Possible Solutions\n\n1. **Polling loop in orchestrator**: After dispatching work, the orchestrator should enter a polling loop (overstory mail check + overstory status) at regular intervals, not just on user prompt.\n\n2. **tmux nudge from agent to orchestrator**: When an agent sends a high-priority message (merge_ready, worker_done, error), also send a tmux send-keys nudge to the orchestrator session to trigger it to check mail.\n\n3. **Watchdog escalation**: The Tier 0 watchdog could detect completed agents and nudge the orchestrator.\n\n4. **PostToolUse hook on agent side**: After an agent sends worker_done mail, a hook could trigger a nudge to the orchestrator's tmux session.\n\nOption 2 (tmux nudge) is probably the most direct — it mirrors how the orchestrator nudges stalled agents but in reverse.\n\n## Impact\n\nWithout this fix, every agent run requires human babysitting at the merge step, which defeats the purpose of autonomous orchestration.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"jayminwest@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T13:06:09.534874-08:00","created_by":"Jaymin West","updated_at":"2026-02-13T14:37:18.884457-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T14:37:18.884457-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented in session: bash path guard, hook capture updates, CLAUDE.md overwrite guard, and orchestrator nudge fix"}

Commands like 'echo content \u003e /path/to/root/file.txt', 'cp file /root/path/', 'mv', 'sed -i' with absolute paths outside the worktree are not caught.\n\n## Current State\n\nhooks-deployer.ts has buildBashFileGuardScript() for non-implementation agents that blocks ALL file-modifying bash commands. But builders are intentionally exempt from this — they need sed, cp, etc. The problem is they can use these commands with paths outside their worktree.\n\n## Solution\n\nFor builder/merger agents, add a Bash PreToolUse hook that:\n\n1. Reads the command from stdin JSON\n2. For file-modifying patterns (sed -i, echo \u003e, cp, mv, tee, cat \u003e, etc.), extracts target file paths\n3. Validates that all target paths resolve within the worktree boundary\n4. Blocks if any target path is outside the worktree\n\nThis is harder than the Write/Edit guard because bash commands have varied syntax. A pragmatic approach:\n- Extract all absolute paths from the command (anything starting with /)\n- Check that none start with the canonical repo root UNLESS they start with the worktree path\n- For relative paths, they resolve from the tmux cwd (which is the worktree) so they're OK\n\n## Complexity Note\n\nThis is inherently harder to make airtight than the Write/Edit guard. An agent could theoretically construct paths via variable expansion, cd to a different directory, etc. The guard should catch the common case (direct absolute paths) and document known limitations.\n\n## Files to modify\n\n- src/agents/hooks-deployer.ts — new buildBashPathBoundaryScript()\n- src/agents/hooks-deployer.test.ts — test cases","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jayminwest@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T13:03:14.28314-08:00","created_by":"Jaymin West","updated_at":"2026-02-13T14:37:18.817527-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T14:37:18.817527-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented in session: bash path guard, hook capture updates, CLAUDE.md overwrite guard, and orchestrator nudge fix","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"overstory-loa7","depends_on_id":"overstory-4200","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-13T13:03:28.08919-08:00","created_by":"Jaymin West"}]}

Fix known data gaps (tool args, durations, tokens, exit codes). Eliminate sessions.json race condition.\n\n## Deliverables\n1. Central EventStore (src/events/store.ts) — SQLite events.db with schema for all event types\n2. Smart tool argument filter (src/events/tool-filter.ts) — extract useful args per tool type, skip noise\n3. SessionStore (src/sessions/store.ts) — SQLite replacement for sessions.json with concurrent access safety\n4. Sessions migration shim (src/sessions/compat.ts) — backward-compatible reader during transition\n5. Hook updates — pipe full stdin JSON to overstory log, capture tool_input, transcript_path, session_id\n6. Log command updates — parse hook stdin, write to events.db, correlate tool durations, auto-parse transcripts\n7. Migrate all sessions.json consumers (sling, status, daemon, nudge) to SessionStore\n\n## Architecture Notes\n- events.db schema: id, run_id, agent_name, session_id, event_type, tool_name, tool_args (filtered JSON), tool_duration_ms, level, data (JSON payload), created_at\n- SessionStore schema mirrors current AgentSession type but in SQLite with proper indexes\n- Tool duration correlation: tool_end queries most recent unmatched tool_start for same (agent, tool), computes delta\n- Smart defaults for tool args: Bash→command, Read→file_path, Write→file_path, Edit→file_path, Grep→pattern+path, Task→description+subagent_type.

Keeps test setup DRY across worktree, resolver, and sling tests.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jayminwest@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-12T08:56:10.598442-08:00","created_by":"Jaymin West","updated_at":"2026-02-12T09:00:03.92038-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-12T09:00:03.92038-08:00","close_reason":"Created src/test-helpers.ts with createTempGitRepo(), commitFile(), cleanupTempDir() + src/test-helpers.test.ts (8 tests passing)"}
{"id":"overstory-yhbn","title":"Phase 3: Auto-propulsion system (self-dispatching workers)","description":"Implement an auto-propulsion mechanism so agents self-execute when work is assigned rather than waiting for explicit commands. Core principle: when work appears on an agent's assignment, they MUST execute it. Key components: (1) Assignment binding - atomic association of a beads issue to an agent at spawn time (stored in agent session, not an .md file), (2) Hook-driven activation - SessionStart checks for bound work and begins immediately, (3) No idle state for workers - complete task, self-clean, exit. No lingering sessions, (4) Self-cleaning lifecycle: worker signals completion, pushes branch, requests own termination, (5) Task group tracking: auto-close task groups when all member issues resolve, notify coordinator. This replaces the current manual 'orchestrator decides everything' model with propulsion-driven autonomy.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jayminwest@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-12T13:50:50.06679-08:00","created_by":"Jaymin West","updated_at":"2026-02-13T06:37:11.551274-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T06:37:11.551274-08:00","close_reason":"Phase 3 auto-propulsion implemented: (1) builder.md updated with worker_done mail protocol and MISSING_WORKER_DONE failure mode, (2) overlay.ts quality gates now include worker_done signal step, (3) prime.ts injects activation context for bound tasks so agents self-start even if beacon is lost, (4) group.ts sends mail notification to coordinator on auto-close","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"overstory-yhbn","depends_on_id":"overstory-b3u0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-12T13:51:33.087222-08:00","created_by":"Jaymin West"},{"issue_id":"overstory-yhbn","depends_on_id":"overstory-p6pn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-12T13:51:33.648108-08:00","created_by":"Jaymin West"}]}

The Claude Code TUI showed the prompt text but never started processing it. A manual 'tmux send-keys Enter' was needed to trigger the agent. The 2s sleep in sling.ts (line ~356) before sendKeys may not be enough for Claude Code's TUI to fully initialize. Possible fixes: (1) increase the sleep, (2) poll tmux pane for readiness indicator before sending, (3) send an extra Enter after the beacon.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"jayminwest@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-12T13:50:45.144963-08:00","created_by":"Jaymin West","updated_at":"2026-02-12T14:01:09.49012-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-12T14:01:09.49012-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented typed mail protocol with 8 new message types + payload column, structural tool enforcement hooks, and beacon sendKeys fix"}
