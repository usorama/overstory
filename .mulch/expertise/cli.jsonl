Use getFlag(args, '--name') for valued flags and hasFlag(args, '--json') for booleans. Use process.stdout.write (not console.log) for output. Wrap in try/finally to close DB stores. Use ValidationError for bad input, domain-specific errors (AgentError, MailError, MergeError) for operation failures.","classification":"tactical","recorded_at":"2026-02-12T15:40:08.301Z","tags":["cli","commands","patterns"],"id":"mx-4cd4ed"}
